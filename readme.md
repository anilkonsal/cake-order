# Cake Order App

This is a Laravel app which has two components:

1. Order Form
2. Orders List

For the purpose of this example, we have used hostname as cake.app, so the project is running locally as 
http://cake.app. All the URLs in future will be relative to this hostname.


## Order Form

This form has five fields which are used to get user's input about the cake he wants to order. 

This page cane be seen at http://cake.app/cake


## Orders List

After the orders are there in database, you can see the orders at http://cake.app/orders. There is a button at the 
end of each row to mark the status of order as done.
